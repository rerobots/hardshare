# FAQ

**hardshare** is a system for sharing your hardware through the [rerobots](https://rerobots.net/)
infrastructure.

Before you can share things, you must have a user account on rerobots.
The service is not yet generally available, but you can [ask for
an account](https://rerobots.net/contact).

The source code repository is at <https://github.com/rerobots/hardshare>
