# Tutorial: Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21

This tutorial begins where [Quickstart](/quickstart) ended and demonstrates
onboarding of a [Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/).


## Prerequisites

Before sharing a device via hardshare, check that you can work with it directly.
The main intuition of hardshare is to add reproducibility to a workspace that is
already known to be operational.


## Prepare Docker image

To facilitate efficient reproducibility, we want to prepare a container
image that has requirements already installed so the user can simply
"build-and-flash" without having to wait for additional toolchains to be
downloaded, built, etc.


## Add USB device to hardshare configuration


## Termination scripts


## Stream video


## Make a sandbox
