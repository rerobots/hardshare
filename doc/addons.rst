Add-ons
=======

All workspace deployments provided by rerobots_ and all devices provided by
hardshare users support the core API. Additional features, referred to as
*add-ons*, can also be made available if sufficient hardware requirements are
satisfied.

For example, many workspaces include cameras. The add-on ``cam`` enables working
with cameras via ``api.rerobots.net``
