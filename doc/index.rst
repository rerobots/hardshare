hardshare
=========

**hardshare** is a system for sharing your robot through the rerobots_
infrastructure. It is in the early stages of development.

Before you can share your robots, you must have a user account on rerobots.
The service is not yet generally available, but if you are interested, `ask for
an account <https://rerobots.net/contact>`_.

The source code repository is at https://github.com/rerobots/hardshare
