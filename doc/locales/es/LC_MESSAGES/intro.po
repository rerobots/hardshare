"The word \"robot\" is broadly interpreted here: essentially, it is a "
"device or collection of devices that are connected somehow. The robot and"
" the surrounding environment are together known as a `workspace "
"deployment <https://help.rerobots.net/prelim.html>`_. Robots that are "
"owned and managed by the company rerobots are always presented as "
"workspace deployments with unique IDs.  To share your robot via "
"hardshare, it also must be assigned a unique ID."

"The \"rerobots infrastructure\" is stuff described at "
"https://help.rerobots.net/ and includes facilities like `a Python client "
"library <https://rerobots-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and sandboxes_."

"The hardshare client is the part that manages the lifecycle of remote "
"access, including advertising that the robot is available, creating SSH "
"tunnels to a local container, and enforcing constraints like input "
"filters."

"The time during which a user has exclusive access to a workspace "

"<https://help.rerobots.net/prelim.html>`_.  The process of requesting, "
"getting credentials, and terminating an instance is similar to how you "
"might get a \"compute node\" from a \"cloud computing\" company, like "
"Packet_ or DigitalOcean_:"

"The rerobots/hardshare architecture provides for specifying how hardware "
"appears to an instance. If carefully configured, any device can be shared"
" through instances safely and securely. The precise meanings of *safe* "
"and *secure* depend on the hardware in the workspace deployment, but the "
"basic organization is the same: associate actions with lifecycle events "
"(e.g., initialization), and monitor input and output streams."

"The default configuration of a new hardshare client installation does not"
" enforce any contracts. Instances in this case have unfiltered access to "
"hardware. This can be a good first choice in trusted settings, such as a "
"team working closely together at a company."
