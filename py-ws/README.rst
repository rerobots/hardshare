Introduction
------------

**hardshare** is the client part of a system for sharing your robot hardware
through the rerobots infrastructure. It is in the early stages of development.
Until the first released version, the protocol can change without warning.

This Python package provides the CLI and WebSocket-based daemon for the client
side. The official repository is at https://github.com/rerobots/hardshare
