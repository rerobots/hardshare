Supported robots
================

This directory contains code and configuration data for particular robots.  Our
ambition is to make sharing your robot with **hardshare** as easy as possible.
However, there are many different possible configurations of commercially
available robots, as well as home-grown robots. So, support is mainly provided
through templates that require some modification on a case-by-case basis.
